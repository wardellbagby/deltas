# Tracks

The social app for tracking things in your life that change!

## What is it?

Tracks is an app where you can create "trackers" and share them with your friends! A tracker is a
label and either a number or a time. For instance, a tracker can be the number of times you've
missed your friend or how long it's been since you've hung out! When you update that tracker, any
friends you've shared it with will get a notification.

## What's in this repo?

This repo contains both the code for the Android app and the Server the app communicates with.
