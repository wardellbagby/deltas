# Tracks

The social app for tracking things in your life that change!

## What is it?

Tracks is an app where you can create "trackers" and share them with your friends!

### What's a "tracker?"

A tracker is a label and either a number or a time. For instance, a tracker can be the number of
times you've
missed your friend or how long it's been since you've hung out! When you update that tracker, any
friends you've shared it with will get a notification.

### How do I install it?

Currently, there are no publicly available releases as I continue to iterate on what this app will
be, but you're more than free to clone the repo and build your own release before this officially
launches.

## What's in this repo?

This repo contains both the code for the Android app and the code for the server that the Android
app expects to communicate with.
